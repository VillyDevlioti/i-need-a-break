        <h2>About This Project</h2>
        <p>When we think about 2020, a collective anxiety sets in. In our conversations, in the tenseness of our shoulders,
        in the constant demands for change… and the heartbeat behind this anxiety? The Election. The Election. 
        <br/><br/>THE FUCKING ELECTION. <br/><br/>
        Will art save the day? Maybe not entirely. But we think the idea of a complete brain break, a zone out, 
        a way to disconnect from the news and the noise, is a way to recharge. Plus, these 15 artists are some of the best and most compelling out there.
        <hr />
        Vote. Volunteer. Stay Informed. Lift Your Voice. Then, CHILL WITH US. As many times as you need throughout Election Week. We’ll be here manifesting and centering and shit.</p>
