        <h2>About This Project</h2>
        <p>When we think about 2020, a collective anxiety sets in. In our conversations, in the tenseness of our shoulders, in the constant demands for change with seemingly little change from our leaders… and the heartbeat behind this anxiety? 
        The Election. The Pandemic. The Fight Against Racism. The Supreme Court. The Election Again. <br />
        And We Go On….
        Will art save the day? Maybe not entirely. But we think the idea of a complete brain break, a zone out, a way to disconnect for just a little bit from the news and the noise, is a nice way to recharge and reset. <br />
        Plus, these 16 artists are some of the best and most compelling out there. </p>
